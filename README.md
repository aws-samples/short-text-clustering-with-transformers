# Short text clustering using transformer models on ASW SageMaker

***

## Name
Short text clustering using transformer models on ASW SageMaker

## Description
This project shows you how to create a short text clustering pipeline using transformer models on AWS SageMaker to generate text embeddings which will then be used by a clustering algorithm to create clusters of short text. The project also employs NLP techniques to assign labels to each cluster so that they can be automatically labeled.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge

## Usage
Run the notebook in a [SageMaker Studio notebook](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/notebooks.html). The notebook is self-guided and contains instructions for each step to be executed.
